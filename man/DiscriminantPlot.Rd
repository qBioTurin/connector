\usage{
DiscriminantPlot(clusterdata, h, data, feature, save = FALSE,
  path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{clusterdata}{The list obtained from extrapolating the most probable clustering from the StabilityAnalysis function output. (see \code{\link{StabilityAnalysis}} and \code{\link{MostProbableClustering.Extrapolation}}).}

\item{h}{The number between 1 or 2 representing the dimension of the cluster mean space (see \code{\link{PCA.Analysis}}).}

\item{data}{CONNECTORList. (see \code{\link{DataImport}} or \code{\link{DataTruncation}})}

\item{save}{If TRUE then the discriminant plots colored depending on the feature and the cluster membership are saved.}

\item{path}{The folder path where the plot(s) will be saved. If it is missing, the plot is saved in the current working  directory.

 @return
 DiscriminantPlot visualizes two versions of the same discriminant linear plot, showing in a h-dimensional space the cluster membership of each curve. In the first case the symbols identifying the elements of different clusters are colored depending on the cluster membership, and in the second plot the symbols are colored depending the selected feature.}

\description{
Gives a simple visualization regarding in which cluster each sample belongs.
